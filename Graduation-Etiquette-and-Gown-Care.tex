\noindent In this brief guide we will tell you about caring for your graduation gown, about the graduation etiquette, and a little bit about our gown donation program. If at the end of the graduating ceremony you see us holding ``Gown Donations'' sign please consider donating any regalia that you no longer need. Those gowns will help future generation of Grad Red Raiders.

\section{Caring For Your Gown}\label{sec:page-layout}

\subsection{The ``natural way''}
Remove the gown and place on a hanger to allow the folds to fall out, and hang your gown in a high humidity area. A bathroom after a hot shower may be good location.

  \label{fig:40C}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The ``steamy way''}
Consider steaming your gown to remove any wrinkles and freshen it up. Please note that all gowns that the Graduate Student Advisory Council rents out have been previously steam-cleaned.

\begin{marginfigure}[-18\baselineskip]%
\hspace*{0.01in}

  \label{fig:bleach}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The ``not recommended way''}
\marginnote{Please note that many doctoral gowns should not be ironed. They can only be dry cleaned or steamed. Always follow cleaning instructions provided with your gown.}
If you wish to press your gown, turn it inside out and press with a warm, but \underline{not hot} iron. Always iron exclusive of any decoration a gown may have.

\hspace*{0.02in}

  \caption{Low heat iron inside out}
  \label{fig:iron}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The ``I am really busy way \#1''}
Your friendly neighborhood dry cleaner can steam the gown for you. Please note that it may be expensive, we would say about \$10.

\begin{marginfigure}[-2\baselineskip]%

  \label{fig:dry-clean}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{The ``I am really busy way \#2''}
If you are considering dry cleaning your gown you may want to ask your dry-cleaner to use ``green'' cleaning agents. Some of the traditional dry-cleaning chemicals have been linked to cancer. Odds are that smaller neighborhood dry cleaners may not be using eco-friendly cleaners unless specifically requested.

\section{Dress Code}
In dressing for the graduation it is important to balance dress requirements and comfort. The guiding principle is that your clothing is either covered by the gown, blends in with the gown, or is in harmony with the gown. We recommend at least a business casual dress but also ask that you dress to minimize discomfort. Remember you will not only sit, stand, and walk during the graduation ceremony itself, but also for about two hours during the practice phase. 

\subsection{Women Dress Code}
We recommend wearing dark bottoms: slacks, dress, or skirt, and a light-colored top: dress blouse or dress shirt. 
If you decide to wear a dress we recommend more lightweight choices so the dress does not interfere with shape of the gown. Dresses and skirts should also be shorter than the gown.

We recommend wearing dark shoes: flats or pumps. High heels are not recommended out of concern for your safety and comfort. Sandals and tennis shoes should be avoided. Please make sure not to bring anything with you that will not fit in your pockets. Purses will not be allowed in the graduation court.

  \caption{\linespread{1.3}\selectfont{}No purses, bags, or backpacks are allowed in the graduation court.}
  \label{fig:bag}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Men Dress Code}
We recommend wearing dark bottoms: trousers or khakis and ironed or pressed light-colored dress shirt with a dark tie. We recommend wearing dark dress shoes and dark socks. Jeans, shorts, sandals and tennis shoes should be avoided. Please make sure not to bring anything with you that will not fit in your pockets

\end{marginfigure}

\section{Academic Gown}
In order to look sharp for those pictures that will haunt you for years to come make sure to prepare your gown the day before. We recommending steaming it or dry-cleaning it to remove any wrinkles. A well-fit gown will end midway between the knee and ankle.

\subsection{Masters vs. Doctoral Gowns}

\paragraph{Master's gowns} By convention master's gowns are untrimmed and can be easilly identified by their characteristic sleeves. Sleeves have oblong shape with its rear part square cut and the front part with an arc cut away. Sleeves are open at the wrist with the sleeve base hanging down.

\paragraph{Doctoral gowns} Doctoral gowns have bell-shaped sleeves decorated with three bars of velvet. Front of the gown is also decorated with velvet along the zipperline. Velvet may be either black or of the color distinctive of the disciplines to which the degree pertains. Most commonly you see those decorations in black or dark blue. While traditionally dark blue has been reserved for the field of philosophy, here it designates mastery of the discipline of learning and scholarship irrespective of the field of study. 

\subsection{Hood}
\paragraph{How to wear your hood?}The hood should be worn draped around your neck with the largest portion of the hood hanging down your back. The velvet border, which indicates your specific field of study, should be showing on the outside. The velvet should fold under on the lower back to allow the colors of your College or University to show. To keep your hood from being too tight against your neck, there is a cord on the front to help secure it to a shirt button, or pin to a blouse or dress. Many hoods also have a cord and button in the back to prevent your hood from slipping off of your shoulders.

\begin{marginfigure}[-12\baselineskip]%
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{red-cross}
  \caption{\linespread{1.3}\selectfont{}Putting a hood can be tricky but don't worry, we will have someone on the floor of the practice court who will help you make it right!}
  \label{fig:help}
\end{marginfigure}

Academic hoods are black with linings and trimmings that vary across degrees, disciplines, and academic institutions.
\paragraph{Lining}Hoods are lined with the official color or colors of your university. In case of multiple colors hood lining could be divided in variety of ways including chevron or chevrons, equal division of the lining, and alike. Manufacturers of academic regalia and campus or local bookstores often maintain complete files on the approved colors for your degree and university combination.
\paragraph{Trimming}The binding or edging of the hood should be of velvet or velveteen and be three inches wide for master's degrees, and five inches wide for doctoral degrees. Color of the trimming should reflect the subject of the studies. For a list of areas of study and corresponding colors see Table 1. If you are graduating with degree in multiple disciplines you will need to pick one. Unfortunately, the Academoc Costume Code does not allow dividing hood border to represent more than a single degree. All hoods should beof the same material as that of the gown. Doctoral hoods only should have panels at the sides.
\paragraph{Length} Master's degree hoods should be three and one-half feet long, and the doctoral degree hoods should be four feet long. 
 
\subsection{Mortarboard (fancy way of saying a graduation cap!)}
Contrary to common belief your graduation cap should be worn flat on your head and not tilted on the back of your head. The front of the cap should be marked on the inside of your cap.
While men are expected to remove their caps during the school song and the National Anthem, women can keep their caps on.

\begin{marginfigure}[-10\baselineskip]%
  \includegraphics[width=.5\linewidth]{cap-flat}
  \caption{\linespread{1.3}\selectfont{}Wear your graduation cap flat on your head.}
  \label{fig:flat}
\end{marginfigure}

\subsection{Tassel}

\begin{marginfigure}[\baselineskip]%

  \includegraphics[width=.45\linewidth]{capbwR}
  \caption{\linespread{1.3}\selectfont{}Tassel worn to the right before your degree is conferred}
  \label{fig:cap-right}
\end{marginfigure}

Tassels are usually worn on the right side and shifted to the left at the end of the graduation ceremony when your degree is officially conferred. Graduation speaker will generally tell you when it is okay to shift your tassel from right to left.

\section{Brief History of Academic Regalia}

The custom of wearing academic gowns, hoods, and caps dates back to about the 12th century, when most scholars belonged to a religious order.

Long gowns and hoods were standard dress for medieval clergy, who often studied and taught in cold buildings. The style and coloring of the robe, hood, and, sometimes, skull cap denoted an edu­cated individual. From the end of the 16th century to the present, members of the clergy, law profes­sionals, and academics have worn robes.

Sometime in the 14th century, English univer­sities began to use the dress to distinguish levels of education. Modeled on the English system, the American Academic Costume Code was estab­lished in 1895 by a commission of delegates from the Ivy League and New York universities.

The Costume Code calls for three types of gowns: doctoral, master’s, and bachelor’s. The doc­toral gown is the most elaborate, with front-facing velvet and three velvet bars on each of the full, bil­lowing sleeves. The velvet can be black, PhD blue, or the academic color to which the degree corre­sponds. The master’s gown is distinctive for its ex­tremely long, closed sleeves, the arms protruding through a slit at the elbow. The bachelor’s gown is the simplest of the three, a plain gown with long, pointed sleeves.

Doctoral and master’s degrees are also indicat­ed by a hood, distinctive in shape, size, and color. The doctor’s hood is easily recognizable, with wide velvet edging that indicates the degree earned and full exposure of the lining. The master’s hood is the same length as the doctor’s hood but does not fully expose the lining, and the velvet edging is not as wide. For both hoods, the lining indicates the col­ors of the institution conferring the degree.

Mortarboards, the distinctive four-pointed caps, are worn by academics at all levels. In recent years, doctors have taken to wearing a soft velvet tam instead.
